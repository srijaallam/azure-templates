## High Availability for FortiWeb on Azure

FortiWeb's High Availability (HA) solution on Azure uses Azure Load Balancer to achieve Active-Active HA and Active-Passive HA.

![Example Diagram](./images/fortiweb-ha.png)

The following resources will be created during the deployment process:

- An Azure Load Balancer with a public IP address.
- Two FortiWeb-VM instances. By default, these two VMs are added to the Azure Load Balancer's backend pool.
- A public-facing subnet connecting the FortiWeb outgoing interface (port1) to the Azure Load Balancer.
- A private subnet where one or more web application VMs that FortiWeb protects are located.

### How it works

All web traffic passes through the Azure Load Balancer first and is then directed to a collection of VMs called a backend pool. In the diagram above, the pool consists of FortiWeb-VM1 and FortiWeb-VM2.

In the Active-Active HA scenario, web traffic is distributed between FortiWeb-VM1 and FortiWeb-VM2.

In the Active-Passive HA scenario, web traffic is directed only to the master node (FortiWeb-VM1 in the diagram above). When FortiWeb-VM1 fails to operate, the Azure Load Balancer will distribute web traffic to FortiWeb-VM2, which is now the master node.
